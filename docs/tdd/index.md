## üìä Requirements Traceability

Each TDD maps back to specific functional requirements (FR-XXX) and non-functional requirements (NFR-XXX) defined in the Product Requirements Document.

## üîÑ Document Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Initial technical exploration and design
2. **Review**: Team review and architectural validation
3. **Approved**: Ready for implementation
4. **Implemented**: Code matches specification
5. **Deprecated**: Superseded by newer design

## üìù TDD Template

When creating new TDDs, use the following structure:

```markdown
# [Document Title]

**Status**: [Draft/Review/Approved/Implemented/Deprecated]
**Owner**: [Technical Lead]
**Reviewers**: [Team Members]
**Last Updated**: [Date]

## Overview
