## Final Technical Specification

* **Core Engine:** A framework-agnostic `SlowTrackRecorder` class within the `@beings/core` package.
* **Architecture:** A client-centric model using a dedicated Web Worker for all encoding and muxing.
* **Codec Strategy:** **Intelligent 4-tier codec fallback chain: AV1 → HEVC → H.264 → VP9** with automatic container selection (MP4/WebM) and hardware acceleration preference.
* **Audio Processing:** Multi-codec audio support (Opus, AAC, MP3, FLAC) with automatic mono-to-stereo upmixing and sample rate preservation.
* **Data Integrity:** The engine operates on a **"no dropped frames"** policy, prioritizing data completeness with timeout-protected codec checking.
* **Hardware Compatibility:** Real-time video downscaling with selectable resolution targets, aspect ratio preservation, and comprehensive hardware acceleration detection.
* **Key "Moat" Features:** The architecture includes **advanced diagnostic capabilities**, **intelligent codec intelligence**, and is designed to support future **frame-accurate time synchronization** and **end-to-end encryption**.

## Implementation Status: Core Engine Complete + Production Hardening

The core recording engine is complete with comprehensive hardware compatibility and diagnostic capabilities.

### **✅ Core Architecture & Lifecycle**
* **Architectural Scaffolding:** The `@beings/core` package, `tsconfig.json`, and `vitest` test environment are fully configured.
* **Full Recording Lifecycle:** The `start()` and `stop()` methods are fully implemented with robust error handling.
* **Worker Communication:** Type-safe, bidirectional message channel between main thread and worker.
* **End-to-End Testing:** Integration tests validate the complete recording pipeline.

### **✅ Hardware Compatibility & Performance**
* **Dynamic Resolution Scaling:** Real-time video downscaling using `OffscreenCanvas` for high-resolution screens (3426×2214 → 1920×1080).
* **Selectable Resolution Targets:** User-configurable resolution options (Auto, 4K, 1080p, 720p, 540p) for hardware compatibility testing.
* **Dynamic Configuration:** Stream-aware encoder configuration using actual frame rates and dimensions from `MediaStream`.
* **Hardware Optimization:** `latencyMode: 'realtime'` for improved encoder performance with screenshare content.
* **Aspect Ratio Preservation:** Smart scaling maintains original proportions with 16-pixel alignment for hardware compatibility.
* **Hardware Acceleration Detection:** Multi-layered detection using WebGL renderer analysis and GPU capabilities assessment.
* **Intelligent Codec Selection:** Timeout-protected codec support checking (2s timeout) with automatic fallback progression.

### **✅ Diagnostic & Monitoring Tools**
* **Comprehensive Test Interface:** Interactive manual test page with dark mode, zoom controls, and responsive design.
* **System Health Monitoring:** Real-time CPU pressure, memory usage, and disk space monitoring using modern browser APIs.

* **Performance Metrics:** Live FPS, encoder queue size, and bitrate monitoring during recording.
* **Codec Support Matrix:** Real-time testing of all codec profiles with hardware acceleration status reporting.
* **Audio Stream Analysis:** Sample rate detection, channel configuration, and bitrate analysis with upmixing diagnostics.

### **✅ Production-Ready Error Handling**
* **Configuration Validation:** Pre-flight checks for encoder compatibility before recording starts.
* **Graceful Degradation:** Fallback handling for unsupported browser APIs.
* **Resource Cleanup:** Proper memory management and worker termination.
* **User Feedback:** Clear status messages and error reporting throughout the recording process.
