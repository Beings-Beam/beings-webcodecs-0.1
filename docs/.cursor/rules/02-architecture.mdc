# üèóÔ∏è v1.0 Architecture

## Official Project Plan
All development is governed by the **`PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md`**. This rule file summarizes the key architectural decisions for easy reference.

## Dual-Track Architecture
The v1.0 architecture is composed of two primary systems working in concert:

1.  **Fast Track (Live)**: A low-latency conversational experience using P2P (for 1:1) and a lightweight SFU (for 3+) connections. This track prioritizes responsiveness.
2.  **Slow Track (Archival)**: A local, high-fidelity, client-encrypted media pipeline. It uses a chunked manifest for resumable uploads via `tus` to guarantee data integrity. This track prioritizes quality and reliability.

### Monorepo Structure (PNPM Workspace)
```
/packages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/      # Slow-Track Engine (WASM, WebCodecs, Timebase, Manifest)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react/     # React Hooks & Context for the client-side app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/        # Presentational UI Component Library (Storybook)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app/       # The main web application (Integration Layer)
```

### Package Dependency Rules
- **`@beings/core`**: Must have ZERO framework dependencies. Contains the core logic for the "Slow Track".
- **`@beings/react`**: Depends only on `@beings/core` and the React ecosystem.
- **`@beings/ui`**: Purely presentational; receives all state via props.
- **`@beings/app`**: The integration layer that consumes all other packages.
